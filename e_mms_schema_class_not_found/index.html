Naturally there was a rule extension in place that needed updating as well so we dutifully opened up the code and changed that as well – which is where things started to get strange.</p><p>Everything compiled as expected but when we went to the FIM console and previewed one of our users, it failed with an E_MMS_SCHEMA_CLASS_NOT_FOUND error.</p><p>This worried me for two reasons – one, it’s not an error I remember seeing before, and slightly more worryingly, when I went to google to see if I could find anything out about it, there apparently aren’t any results!</p><p><a href="http://identitytechnology.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image.png"><img loading="lazy" title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/33/image_thumb.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/33/responsive/image_thumb-xs.png 300w, https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/33/responsive/image_thumb-sm.png 480w, https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/33/responsive/image_thumb-md.png 768w" width="651" height="327"></a></p><p>After running down a few false leads (it’s not my project and there were a few custom libraries and tools in place) we managed to link this back to a fault in our code – it worked out that we had two similarly named attributes in place, EmailAddress and EmailAddresses and had referred to the wrong one when we were adding and removing values.</p><p>Simple enough to fix but an odd error that appears to be thrown if you try to access the Values collection of a single value attribute – although hopefully next time I encounter the error I’ll at least have a clue what I’ve done wrong!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 9, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/authors/identity_jason/" class="invert" rel="author">identity_jason</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">&copy; Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/main.min.js?v=448f4c9d4b4c374766a1cb76c3d88048"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
