including moving some functions into a central library rather than copying and pasting code between workflow activities because that always ends well...</p><p>So when I added a new class to my Workflow Activity I was a little bemused when it didn't become available when I enumerated the public methods of the containing DLL via the GetExportedTypes() method - it was particularly odd (with hindsight) as a previous DLL I'd altered was fine, but the one I'd amended - by copying and pasting in the code from the previous build didn't appear to have the new methods available.</p><p>Cue the inevitable "hokey-cokey" classes where I'd add the new class, rebuild, test via powershell, remove it and try again (now that was a fun afternoon!) before spotting that if I quit powershell and reloaded it then the "missing" class suddenly became visible.</p><p>Turns out that if I'd been paying attention, I'd have realized that .net doesn't allow unloading of assemblies - and while with a standalone executable it's "AppDomain" is destroyed at the end of execution, effectively unloading anything you've loaded, powershell counts it's session rather than the lifetime of a script as it's execution and once you've loaded the DLL in once, it's there for the lifetime of the powershell instance.</p><p>Seem the way to get around it would be either to try stand something up via a temporary App Domain, but quite how to get that into Powershell may be a whole new adventure - most of the people talking about it online are creating wrapper applications around their dll loads to artificially partition up and protect their powershell sessions - so in a nutshell, if you're seeing odd behaviour with the load script OR are getting lots of dll open in another application that you're not expecting, it may well be worthwhile quitting powershell and opening a new session to see if that fixes things.</p><p>"Switch it off and back on again" still rules - even with the joys of Powershell and .net!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 9, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/authors/identity_jason/" class="invert" rel="author">identity_jason</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">&copy; Editorial 2 -
