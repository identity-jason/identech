Contact your system administrator."</p><p>The good news is that a little surgery inside the VM folder to remove it's .vmpl file and remove the policy lines from within the .vmx file</p><p>printers.enabled = "TRUE" extendedConfigFile = "Live_at_FIM.vmxf" <span style="color: #ff6600;">policy.vm.mvmtid = "52 62 b3 21 92 c6 0e 24-11 16 c1 09 1f 54 64 b6"</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">policy.vm.managedVMTemplate = "TRUE"</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">policy.vm.managedVM = "FALSE"</span></p><p>and it all starts working again as normal - I'm just a little disappointed that I've needed to go and start hacking about inside the VM for something that was working perfectly before I started the upgrade - and that I've now got to go and do this across a library of virtual machines so that I don't get tripped up by this in 3 months time when I go back to an older project.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 9, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/authors/identity_jason/" class="invert" rel="author">identity_jason</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">&copy; Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/main.min.js?v=448f4c9d4b4c374766a1cb76c3d88048"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
