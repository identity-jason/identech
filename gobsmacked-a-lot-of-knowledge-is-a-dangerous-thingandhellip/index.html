Ensure that the server is accessible, the service account is not a local account being used with a remote SQL Server, and that the account doesn’t already have a SQL login</span></em></blockquote><p>So, I checked everything – firewalls, domains, credentials, SQL permissions and verified the connection from powershell to no avail. Ok, it’s SQL so I defined alias to no avail, installed patches, upgraded clients everything that I and the team I’m working with could think to do, we did – in spades.</p><p>Finally, I got to the point of desperation and tried what couldn’t possibly be the solution based on a blog entry I found on the exceedingly well named “<a href="http://perfectresolution.com/?p=16" target="_blank">Over 5 minutes – answers for questions that should be simple</a>”, and changed the case of the domain – instant success, go directly to the group specification page and be on your way.</p><p>So that’s it – if I’d known less about the complicated ways to install FIM, maybe I’d have got to this point sooner – or maybe I’ll learn to check the simple things first next time (now that I know to check</p><figure class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile"><img loading="lazy" style="border-style: none;" src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/2/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/2/responsive/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile-xs.png 300w, https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/2/responsive/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile-sm.png 480w, https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/media/posts/2/responsive/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile-md.png 768w" alt="Winking smile"></figure>)<p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 9, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/authors/identity_jason/" class="invert" rel="author">identity_jason</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">&copy; Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://github.com/identity-jason/identech/assets/js/main.min.js?v=448f4c9d4b4c374766a1cb76c3d88048"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
